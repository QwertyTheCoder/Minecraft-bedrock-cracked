## TODO

1. [x] Automate zipping original DLL files for easy uploading.
2. [x] Automate extracting modified DLL files to the required location.
3. [x] Automate the installation of APPX files, including runtime files and Minecraft.

## System/Windows Requirements

- Operating System: Windows 10 version 1803 (build 17134.0) or higher.
- Developer Mode: Enable [Developer mode](https://www.wikihow.com/Enable-Developer-Mode-in-Windows-10) and restart your computer.
- Sign-in: You should be signed in with a personal Microsoft account in the Microsoft store.
- Optional: [Disable runtime broker](https://www.wisecleaner.com/how-to/107-3-methods-to-fix-runtime-broker-high-cpu-usage-issue.html) if Minecraft crashes.
   Here's how to do that: Open Registry Editor and try to find TimeBrokerSvc from HKEY_Local_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services. Then double click “Start” on the right and change the value from “3” to “4”
